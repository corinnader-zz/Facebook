# Week 4 Project: Facebook
##Overview
This is an assigment I'm working on for the iOS for Designers Bootcamp by CodePath. The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to transition between screens. In this prototype, we're recreating the Facebook app photo behavior. 

###Time spent: 
Lost track. Definitely over 10.

###Completed user stories:

 * [X] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
 * [X] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
 * [X] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
 * [X] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
 
###Notes
I had the photos animating from the correct origin at one point, but I changed something and it stopped working. And, welp, I'm out of time. Yes, I'm coming to office hours. Feeling really lost still. So lost that I'm not sure what questions to ask...



###Walkthrough of all user stories
